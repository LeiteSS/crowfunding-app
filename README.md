# Crow funding Developed in .Net Core 

This app allow the user to help the crow funding get in its goals donating any value. In the App it's possible to see who already made a donation. 

The project was developed using Model-View-Controller architecture, where **model** is where it save, manipulate and generates the data; **view** is where it show the content through user interface, and **controller** is where it takes care of the user's interaction, works with the model and select a view to render.  

Side-by-side the main project there is the project for tests. Using the **Test Driven Development** it was wrote test that fails, but in the first time it's necessary that it pass. When the test pass, the code can be refactor.
